# Voice

Voice dictation transcribes speech with a local speech-to-text model and inserts the result at
the cursor in any app. It ships as a capability of the **Audio** first-party extension (installed
and enabled by default; disable, remove, and restore are supported — see
[Extensions](../extending/extensions.md)). Source lives in
[`Sources/Nativ/Features/VoiceCapture/`](../../Sources/Nativ/Features/VoiceCapture/) and
[`Extensions/VoiceDictation/`](../../Extensions/VoiceDictation/).

## Capture flow

A global shortcut starts capture anywhere. On release/stop, the recording is transcribed and the
text is inserted at the current cursor position; the transcript is also placed on the clipboard.

By default, say **“enter”** as the final word to press Return after inserting the text. For example,
“Send me the details enter” inserts “Send me the details” and then presses Return in the target
app. The command is omitted from the inserted text, clipboard, saved transcript, and dictation
history. Capitalization and trailing punctuation (such as “Enter.”) are ignored. Saying only
“enter” presses Return without pasting text or changing the clipboard. “Enter” elsewhere in a
dictation remains ordinary text. This also applies when retrying a dictation.

In **Audio → Shortcuts → Spoken Return**, turn the command on or off and change its **Trigger
word or phrase** (for example, “send it”). Only the configured trigger at the end of dictation
presses Return; earlier occurrences remain text. **Restore Default** changes the trigger back to
“enter”. Settings are saved automatically and take effect immediately for both speech engines
and retries. Turning the command off or leaving the trigger blank keeps all dictated words in
the transcript without pressing Return.

## Shortcuts and modes

### “Hey Nativ” wake word

Enable **Audio → Shortcuts → Hey Nativ** to start dictation by saying **“hey nativ”**.
Wait for the recording indicator, then speak. Two seconds of silence finishes the recording
and inserts the transcript through the normal dictation flow. You can also use the record
shortcut to finish or the overlay's cancel button to discard it. The wake phrase is heard
before recording starts, so it is not included in the transcript. Wake-started recordings
cancel after ten seconds without speech and finish after at most two minutes.

The setting is off by default and independent of the keyboard's hands-free mode. When enabled,
it keeps the selected microphone active while the Audio extension is running. Wake detection
uses a compact on-device **Hey Nativ** Core ML model that scores a rolling two-second window of
audio directly on the Apple Neural Engine — no transcription and no network. The model is a
one-time download; if it isn't present, the panel shows **Get Model** and links to that model in
[Models](models.md). Listening arms automatically once the download finishes. Background audio
stays in memory and is never saved.

Listening pauses during dictation and transcription, meeting/voice-note capture, audio-library
playback, and system sleep or an inactive login session. Pausing playback resumes wake-word
listening; resuming playback pauses it again. Listening resumes automatically after other audio activity.
Turning the setting off or disabling the Audio extension stops listening. The settings panel
shows preparation, listening, download-needed, and error status, with **Get Model** to fetch the
model and **Try Again** for recovery.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Record | `Control + Option + Command` | Two capture modes (below). |
| Retry | `Fn + R` | Re-transcribes the most recent recording and inserts it again. |

Both shortcuts are configurable on the **Audio** page. The record shortcut supports two modes,
toggled by the hands-free setting:

- **Hands-free** — a clean double-tap of the modifiers starts capture; a second double-tap stops
  it. Held modifier combinations and unrelated key presses do not trigger it.
- **Push-to-talk** — capture runs while the modifiers are held and ends on release.

Modifier-only detection is handled by
[`FnControlShortcutMonitor`](../../Sources/Nativ/Features/VoiceCapture/FnControlShortcutMonitor.swift);
shortcut preferences persist in
[`VoiceShortcut`](../../Sources/Nativ/Features/VoiceCapture/VoiceShortcut.swift).

## Recordings and retention

- Recordings are written as temporary `.wav` files with matching `.txt` transcripts.
- Raw audio is deleted automatically after five minutes, or immediately when the app quits; the
  five-minute window is what makes retry possible. Transcript files remain.
- **Show Voice Recordings** in the menu-bar menu opens the recordings folder.

## Audio page

The **Audio** page inspects dictation history and analytics (words per minute, total words, time
saved, streaks), selects the installed speech-to-text model, chooses the capture animation (a
pointer-following waveform or a camera-cutout pill with a reactive orb and timer), and edits both
shortcuts. When no speech-to-text model is installed, it links directly to filtered speech-model
discovery in [Models](models.md).

## Permissions

- **Microphone** — requested on first capture; required to record.
- **Accessibility** — required so the global shortcut is detected outside the app and so the
  transcript can be inserted at the cursor.

Signed local builds keep Accessibility and microphone authorization across rebuilds because the
signer-bound identity stays stable; unsigned/ad-hoc builds may lose authorization between builds.
